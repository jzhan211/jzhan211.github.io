The input files are simply a vcf file that includes genotype likelihood (or in phred-scale) and a pedigree file that includes relativeness information among individuals (check Examples).The input vcf file can be obtained using commonly used pipeline such as GATK or GotCloud. We also provide a simplified pipeline for tutorial purpose. The initial set of genotype calls is typically generated by examining a single individual at a time. These calls are typically good for deep sequencing data, but less accurate for sequence data in low to modest covarage. They can be greatly improved by models that combine information across sites and individuals and consider the contraints imposed by family constraints.\nNote: To take advantage to LD information, the minimum number of samples in input vcf file needs to be at least 10.

Statistical and computational methods for single cell multi-omics data The study of single cell transcriptome can shed light on cellular and molecular processes at single cell resolution, which is essential for understanding the heterogeneity of cell populations across different conditions. The recently developed droplet-based single cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology and its extension, such as 10X Genomics Chromium system, is able to measure the gene expression and other type of data in tens of thousands of single cells from multiple individuals simultaneously in a short time period and at relatively low cost, making a population-scale single cell transcriptome study feasible. Despite the progress of method developments for analyzing scRNA-seq data from early generation platforms, there is a severe lack of tailored statistical methods and efficient computational tools for analyzing scRNA-seq data increased by an order of magnitude from this new generation platform. Our group is in the first place at the University of Pittsburgh to study single cell transcriptomic profiling using the new droplet-based platform (10X Genomics). Collaborating with world-class experts at UPMC and Pitt, we have generated high-quality scRNA data (thousands of cells per sample) to study human diseases. We are also actively developing novel computational methods to facilitate our ongoing analysis and address new challenges.\nMajor publications:\n  Sun Z, Wang T, Deng K, Wang XF, Lafyatis R, Ding Y, Hu M, Chen W.

AMD Genetics and Disease Prediction Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has led to notable successes in identifying multiple loci associated with the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Disease risk loci have been identified through GWAS, either by individual studies or through meta-analyses of multiple studies from Consortium. On the other hand, there are growing interests on disease progression (e.g. time to advanced AMD). Genome-wide survey on survival or longitudinal type of data has not been formulated and well performed in the area of AMD. Genes that affect AMD progression are largely unknown. Emerging genetic and phenotypic data from our collaborators provide unique opportunity for us to develop statistical methods on existing data sets and facilitate ongoing consortium studies in which we are involved. In addition, synergy of genome-wide genetic data, fundus imaging data and progression outcomes will greatly advance our knowledge about disease biology and its prediction. We are developing statistical and machine learning method to analyze large-scale fundus imaging and genetic data to understand the dynamic change of AMD.\nRecent major publications:\n  Chen W, Stambolian D, Edwards AO, … , Haines JL, Gorin MB, Abecasis GR, Swaroop A.

Genomic Studies of Respiratory Diseases Puerto Ricans share a disproportionate burden of childhood asthma in the United States, no disease-susceptibility genes have been confidently identified in this ethnic group. Over the last decade, our collaborator Dr. Celedon and Dr. Forno has used funding from NIH and other sources and to collect genetic, epigenetic and phenotypic data in over 1000 Puerto Rican and Pittsburgh school-aged children (with and without asthma), including genome-wide (GW) genotypes, expression profiling and DNA methylation from both white blood cells and nasal epithelium. Motivated by the massive high-throughput omics datasets from our collaborator, we are interested in analyze multi-omics data in a unified framework. Understanding interactions among multi-omics data in airway epithelium should reveal epigenomic and transcriptomic profiles associated with asthma and lung function in Puerto Rican children and possibly in other ethnic groups. Particularly, we are trying to understand the following relations among DNA, RNA, methylation, and ATAC-seq data on the same cohort of samples from multiple tissues: A) Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs); B) Methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs); C) Expression quantitative trait methylations (eQTMs); D) chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs).\nMajor publications:\n  Chen W, Boutaoui N, Brehm JM, Han YY, Schmitz C, Cressley A, Acosta-Perez E, Alvarez M, Colon-Semidey A, Baccarelli AA, Weeks DE, Kolls JK, Canino G, Celedon JC.
