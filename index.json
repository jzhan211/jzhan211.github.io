The input files are simply a vcf file that includes genotype likelihood (or in phred-scale) and a pedigree file that includes relativeness information among individuals (check Examples).The input vcf file can be obtained using commonly used pipeline such as GATK or GotCloud. We also provide a simplified pipeline for tutorial purpose. The initial set of genotype calls is typically generated by examining a single individual at a time. These calls are typically good for deep sequencing data, but less accurate for sequence data in low to modest covarage. They can be greatly improved by models that combine information across sites and individuals and consider the contraints imposed by family constraints.\nNote: To take advantage to LD information, the minimum number of samples in input vcf file needs to be at least 10. If you only have a small number of families (e.g. one or two trios), please try polymutt2.\nDownload Binary file:FamLDCaller.

The default is the maximum number. --errorRate: The pre-defined base error rate. Default 0.01. --randomPhased: The initial haplotypes are inferred from the single marker. Default option. --prefix: The prefix of output file --interimInterval: The number of rounds for interim outputs  Note: The pedigree files require complete family structures (both parents must exist in the pedigree file, e.g. for parent-offspring pair, create a \u0026ldquo;fake\u0026rdquo; parent in the pedigree file or code them as unrelated individuals). The order of the names in the pedigree file is NOT necessary to be consistent with that in .vcf file. The computation will be intensive if the number of samples are large. You can use option \u0026ldquo;\u0026ndash;states\u0026rdquo; to reduce the computation cost (e.g. start with \u0026ldquo;\u0026ndash;states 50\u0026rdquo;) To complete our example analysis, we could run:\nExamples Example1: Refine genotypes of 50 sequenced individuals including 10 nuclear families (2 parents + 3 offspring per family).
